# MyPortfolio
Hi, I'm Miles Rhodes and this is my portfolio. I will be uploading games I'm currently working on and games I've worked on in the past.
So i couldnt find the metal heart download. but i have the link so you can play it in a web browser.
one of my partners Gaston uploaded the game to his itch.io profile:
